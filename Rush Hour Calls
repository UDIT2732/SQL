Redfin helps clients to find agents. Each client will have a unique request_id 
and each request_id has several calls. For each request_id, the first call is an 
“initial call” and all the following calls are “update calls”.  How many customers 
have called 3 or more times between 3 PM and 6 PM (initial and update calls combined)?
