Difficulty: Medium
Write a query that returns the rate_type, loan_id and balance of each loan type, and a column that shows what percentage of the submissionâ€™s total balance each loan constitutes.
Tables:
<submissions>
id                      int
balance                 float
interest_rate           float
rate_type               varchar
loan_id                 int
Logic: Sum of a column within each group of rate_type > use sum() over()

SELECT rate_type,
       loan_id,
       balance,
       100 * balance / Sum(balance)
                         OVER(
                           partition BY rate_type) AS PERCENT
FROM   submissions;
