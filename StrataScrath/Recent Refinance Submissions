Recent Refinance Submissions

https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2003-recent-refinance-submissions?python=

Difficulty: Medium

Write a query that joins this submissions table to the loans table and returns the total loan balance on each user’s most recent ‘Refinance’ submission. Return all users and the balance for each of them.

Tables:

<loans>
id              int
user_id         int
created_at      datetime
status          varchar
type            varchar

<submissions>
id              int
balance         float
interest_rate   float
rate_type       varchar
loan_id         int

Logic: first filter out the loans table taking the latest date only > use max() over() and then match that column with original created_date column
